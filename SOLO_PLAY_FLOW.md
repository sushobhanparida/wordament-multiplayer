# Solo Play Flow (Updated - No Lobby)

## Flow Overview

1. **Home Page** → User enters name and clicks "Play Solo"
2. **Room Creation** → Backend creates solo room
3. **Direct Navigation** → Frontend navigates directly to Game Page (skips lobby)
4. **Game Start** → Backend starts game immediately
5. **Game Play** → User plays the game

## Step-by-Step Flow

### 1. Home Page
- User enters player name
- Clicks orange "Play Solo" button
- `handleSoloPlay()` is called
- `createRoom(playerName, 3, true)` is called (3 rounds, solo mode)

### 2. Room Creation
- Backend creates room with `isSolo: true`
- Emits `roomCreated` event with room data
- Frontend receives `roomCreated` event

### 3. Direct Navigation
- Frontend detects `roomData.isSolo === true`
- Immediately navigates to `/game/{roomCode}` (skips lobby)
- Passes `isSolo: true` in navigation state

### 4. Game Start
- Frontend automatically calls `startGame()` for solo rooms
- Backend starts game immediately (no player count check for solo)
- Emits `gameStarted` event with game data

### 5. Game Play
- Game page loads with game board
- Timer starts automatically
- User can play the game

## Key Changes Made

### HomePage.js
- Enhanced navigation logic to detect solo games
- Added logging for solo vs multiplayer detection
- Solo games navigate directly to game page

### Backend (server.js & gameManager.js)
- Solo games can start with 1 player
- Enhanced logging for solo game flow
- Proper handling of solo game state

## Debug Information

### Frontend Console Logs
- "Starting solo play for player: [name]"
- "Solo game detected, navigating directly to game"
- "Starting solo game for room: [roomCode]"
- "Solo game started successfully"

### Backend Terminal Logs
- "Room creation requested by [name] (solo) with 3 rounds"
- "Room [roomCode] created by [name] (solo mode)"
- "Game start requested for room [roomCode]"
- "Game started in room [roomCode]"

## Testing

1. Start both servers
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Enter a name and click "Play Solo"
4. Should go directly to game page (no lobby)
5. Game should start immediately with board visible

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ No lobby page for solo games
- ✅ Direct navigation to game page
- ✅ Immediate game start
- ✅ Game board visible and interactive
- ✅ Timer starts automatically
- ✅ Solo player can play through all rounds

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur:
1. Check browser console for navigation logs
2. Check backend terminal for room/game creation logs
3. Verify socket connection is established
4. Check that `isSolo: true` is being set correctly
