# Debug Information for player.charAt Error

## Error Description
The error `player.charAt is not a function` occurs when the code tries to call `charAt()` on a value that is not a string.

## Root Cause
This typically happens when:
1. The `players` array contains non-string values (null, undefined, objects, etc.)
2. The `players` data is not properly initialized
3. There's a data type mismatch between frontend and backend

## Fixes Applied

### 1. LobbyPage.js
- Added type checking before calling `charAt()`
- Added fallback for non-string values
- Added debugging logs to track players data

### 2. ScoreBoard.js
- Added validation to filter out non-string players
- Added defensive programming to handle invalid data

### 3. SocketContext.js
- Added debugging logs to track data types
- Enhanced error handling for socket events

### 4. Backend (server.js)
- Added debugging logs to track players data being sent
- Enhanced logging for room creation and game start events

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Browser Console** for:
   - "Room created - players data type: ..."
   - "Player joined - players data type: ..."
   - "LobbyPage: Setting players from roomData: ..."

2. **Check Backend Terminal** for:
   - "Server: Emitting roomCreated with players: ..."
   - "Server: Emitting gameStarted with players: ..."

3. **Expected Data Types**:
   - `players` should be an array of strings
   - Each player should be a string value
   - No null, undefined, or object values should be present

## Testing the Fix

1. Start both servers
2. Try to create a solo game
3. Check console logs for any remaining issues
4. Verify that the game loads without errors

## Additional Notes

If the error persists, check:
- Network tab for socket events
- Backend logs for data corruption
- Frontend state management for data type issues
